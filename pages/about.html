            <span id="digi"> Digi</span><span id="lit">Lit</span> is a front-end search engine
            powered by IMDB, Letterboxd, and MyAnimeList (MAL). <span id="digi"> Digi</span><span id="lit">Lit</span> is
            designed to search up any piece of digital literature (hence the name), such as <br> live action or
            animated television shows and movies. This project was created to help teach myself html/css. <br>
            <br>
            To use, simply enter the name of a tv show or movie and click the button that corresponds to whichever site 
            you would like to search on. If you hit enter (and do not click any buttons), <br>you will automatically be
            redirected to IMDB. <br>
